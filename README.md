 # Gear2D

 Gear2D is a flexible component-based data-centric game engine,
 using a data repository as means of component intercomunication.
 Game objects are nothing but holders for the data repository and
 the container of the components.

 Components are created using the C++ language and distributed as 
 shared-object files and are loaded only when attached to an entity. 
 Changes in components doesn't need an engine recompilation.

 Game objects can be defined at the data level using YAML files. 
 Properties defined there are available to components to be used and shared.
