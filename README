 Gear2D Readme

 Gear2D is a extensible game engine and cross-platform.
 The engine itself isn't a game - this is only the runtime
 and development libraries for creating and running games.

 Installation of this runtime is mandatory for those games
 made with Gear2D that don't package the engine within their
 application. Otherwise, installation of this is not necessary.

 If you wish to develop your own games, and that ranges from
 using pre-existing components to developing your own, the
 installation of this application is mandatory.

 If you want to develop the game engine itself, look for
 source releases, not binary releases.
 
 Any doubts, #gear2d@freenode.net or lgfreitas@users.sourceforge.net
 Feedback is highly appreciated.
 
 Thank you.
