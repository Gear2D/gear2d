 This page describes installation process from the source code.
 
 Beforing proceeding, there is a list of things you'll going 
 to need already installed:
 
 Libraries
 
 	Boost C++ libraries: http://www.boost.org/
 	SDL libraries development version: http://www.libsdl.org/
 	SDL_ttf development libraries: http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
 	SDL_image development libraries: http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
 	SDL_mixer development libraries: http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
 Tools
 
 	CMake: http://www.cmake.org/
 	The GNU Compiler collection (MinGW on windows): http://gcc.gnu.org/ or http://www.mingw.org/ for windows
 	GNU Make (mingw32-make on windows): http://www.mingw.org/ or http://www.mingw.org/ for windows
 
 
 COMPILING IN MICROSOFT WINDOWS
 ------------------------------
 
 Prepare for your worst nightmare. Gear2D must be compiled using MinGW
 compiler because third party components (those that don't provide source code)
 are linked against the runtime compiled with MinGW. If you compile it with another
 compiler it might (will for sure!) generate different function names and you will
 not be able to load components at all. Thats why you cannot use Visual C++ or
 Borland or anything else. Besides, people at the GNU team does a very good job.
 
 The good news is that many C++ IDEs under windows already uses MinGW's gcc, so it
 is already installed somewhere if you have such IDE. I will not cover here how to 
 install those libraries mentioned above, I know you are smart enough to google it.
 
 Alright, the compressed sourcecode can be found at the download page, or you can
 checkout it using SVN. You should enter in the source code folder and create a
 directory named "build". Before actually calling cmake, make sure that the bin/
 folder of MinGW and include/ are on the PATH variable. Also, BOOST_ROOT shall
 be set to the place where you installed Boost libaries. SDL libraries shall be
 placed within MinGW's bin, include, and lib folders.

 Create the build folder

       mkdir build
 
 So, inside build/, you should call
 
       cmake ../ -G "MinGW Makefiles"
     
 That will generate your MinGW Makefile. Then you should call

       mingw32-make install
     
 To build it and install. Note that it will be installed, usually, under
 C:\Program Files (x86)\gear2d\bin for the binaries, \lib for its libraries
 and \lib\gear2d\component\ for its components.
 Thats it, hopefully you've built it. If you failed, please complain in the forum
 or on #gear2d@freenode.net.

 COMPILING IN LINUX(-like)
 -------------------------

 Download the sourcecode release or check it out from SVN repository.
 Next, create a "build" directory under the cource code directory (usually its
 trunk/). Inside that, call cmake:

 Build the build folder:

       mkdir build
 
 Call cmake inside it:

       cmake ../
     
 That will give you an Makefile. Call

      make install

 as root (or with sudo, thats your call)
     
 And that will compile and install Gear2D, usually under /usr/local/bin for its
 binaries and /usr/local/lib for its libraries. Components will be under
 /usr/local/lib/gear2d/component/

 You can change that by using -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX on the cmake phase,
 that is:

     cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/

 Be sure that the application can reach the path to where libraries are
 installed (PREFIX/lib).
